I made the switch about a month ago to Red Hat 9 on my development machine.
Unfortunately, that means that I'm using autoconf-2.57, automake-1.6.3,
aclocal-1.6.3, libtoolize-1.4.3, autoheader-2.57, and earlier versions
may have problems coping.  This *should* only affect folks grabbing the
source from CVS, though the configure script included in the tarball may
have difficulties on some systems.  CVS users, please save yourself some
headaches and grab the above-mentioned versions for your development machines.

It appears that debian unstable ships a version of bison labelled "1.875a".
It will not process libnw/sety.y due to a gratuitous backward incompatibility
with the original yacc and previous versions of bison.  Known working versions
include 1.35 (which debian seems to have in its "testing" branch).
