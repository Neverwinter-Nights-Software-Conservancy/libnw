This README reflects version @VERSION@ of @PACKAGE@ dated @RELDATE@.

This package consists of a library (libnw) and several programs for extracting
and manipulating resources from BioWare's Neverwinter Nights game.  Although I
did a lot of the file format deduction myself, I am deeply indebted to a
number of other folks (see file AUTHORS) for insights, clues, tables, and
code.  See file README.tech for some commentary on the data files for NWN.
The rest of the documentation is, alas, sadly lacking, though there are man
pages for the commands.

What's here (roughly in the order they were started):

libnw - a library of common routines used by the rest of the code.  Among them
	is a complete parser for the SET file.

nwresext - a program to list (or extract) resources from the BIF files
	provided by BioWare as "base" resources (including the (new for 1.28)
	resources described by patch.key).

nwaggext - a program to list (or extract) resources from ERF/HAK/MOD/SAV files.
	Now (as of version 1.28.01), it can also create an ERF/HAK/MOD
	(but with no description).

nwtsrefs - a program to read a tileset's SET file, and (recursively) chase
	down all the resources referred to.  (Requires Torlack's nwnmdlcomp
	to convert binary models to ascii.)

nwtsfix - a program to read a tileset's SET file, and adjust counts, build
	primary rules, prompt for custom door types.  (Prompted by a discussion
	with Velmar.)

nwtsmerge - the beginnings of a program to automagically merge tilesets
	(a work in progress).

itpdis - a program to disassemble a number of different kinds of resources
	(they all share the common GFF file format) into XML.  The current
	list includes: ARE, BIC, DLG, FAC, GFF, GIC, GIT, GUI, IFO, ITP,
	JRL, PTT (new in 1.27), UTC, UTD, UTE, UTI, UTM, UTP, UTS, UTT, UTW.

nwstrref - a command line interface to extract the string associated with
	a STRREF.  (New in 1.28.02, this was written purely to test a new
	routine in the library to extract STRREFs.)

nw2da2csv - a command line interface to extract a 2DA, formatting it as
	a CSV (comma separated values) file.  (New in 1.28.03, this was
	written purely to test a new routine in the library to extract 2DA
	resources in a manipulable form.)

nwmrgplc - the beginnings of a placeables hak pak merger.  Not ready for
	prime time: a work very much in progress.  (New in 1.28.03.)

nwareamap - the beginnings of extracting area maps.  Does precious little
	at the moment, but will grow to create full-size area maps.  Currently,
	it displays (defaultly lots of) information about the tilesets and
	tiles referenced in the areas of a module.  Another work very much
	in progress.  (New in 1.29.03.)

There are still lots of debugging printfs in the code, as much of the existing
code started life as investigatory tools.  That will probably be fixed fairly
soon (i.e., once I'm much more confident that the code I have is "correct").
There is also a lot of other ugliness as a result of this code's heritage,
but this is slowly being eliminated as I restructure.

Note that I am actively working on this code, and trying to keep up with
all the new stuff BioWare continues to add via patches.

Eventually, I'd like to provide the ability to add/delete individual resources
to/from ERF/HAK/MOD files.  This will take some time....

Similarly, I'd eventually like to be able to create ITP-like resources from
XML source (such as itpdis produces).  Again, this is more than I currently
have time to bite off.  (Reading the XML is a piece of cake; creating the
binary format BioWare uses is the hard part.)

Of course, there are other tools I'd also like to build, but I haven't yet
fleshed out exactly what I want them to do, or how to do it.

For those keeping score, all of this code was developed under Red Hat
Linux 7.3 initially, and currently Red Hat Linux 9, using all the GNU tools
included therein.

Needless to say, if you like what I've done, or find bugs, please let me
know, and I'll do what my free time permits to fix them.  I really want
folks to use this code, develop their own apps around it, and, hopefully,
permit me to fold their code back into the package!
