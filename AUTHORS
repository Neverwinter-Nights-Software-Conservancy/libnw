I am the primary author of all the code included in this package:
Marty Shannon (mailto:mshannon@domovina.org).

Several folks from the Open Knights consortium (http://openknights.sf.net)
have contributed code and testing.  Among them are:

Peter Gorniak (sumpfork) for lots of endian fixes,
Francois Guimond (Eyrdan),
and of course, our fearless leader,
Rick Shafer (Ras_Kcir).

I've also definitely been helped by lots of information (in no particular order)
from:

I confess there may be others, so if I've forgotten anyone, my humble
apologies, and please let me know if it looks like I've absorbed info from you.

Thanks to all who have made their source code or other information available!

	Marty
