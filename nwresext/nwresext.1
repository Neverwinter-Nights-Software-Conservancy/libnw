.SH "NAME"
nwresext \- list, extract NWN BIF files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
nwresext [-g gamedir] [-v] [-t] [-x] [ resource ... ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
nwresext is a multipurpose command to list or extract resources listed in
NWN's chitin.key file.
.P
With the -t flag, it lists the resources found in the file; adding the -v
flag adds their sizes and offsets.
.P
With the -x flag, it extracts the specified resources (or all of them,
if none are specified), each into its own file, into the current directory;
adding the -v flag prints a '.' on stdout for each resource extracted.
.P
It is an error to use the -t flag with the -x flag.
.P
It is an error to use neither of the -t or -x flags.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success, 0 is returned.
For any fatal error, a non-zero value is returned.
.SH "NOTES"
There are some 43871 resources in the retail NWN (1.27); 1.28 brings it up
to 44107.
Not only does it take a long time to extract all of them (~15 minutes on a
dual Pentium-3 @ 850MHz), it also makes for a very large output directory.
.SH "BUGS"
The NWN override directory is ignored.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
NWN_GAME_DIR: the root of the game directory, overridden by the -g flag.
